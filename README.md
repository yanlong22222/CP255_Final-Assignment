# CP255_Final-Assignment

The privately-owned public open spaces (POPOS) are spaces that are provided and maintained by private developers and provide great value to workers, residents, and visitors [1]. As publicly accessible spaces, there are 78 POPOS in downtown San Francisco [2]. Some of them are easy to access and used by the public; however, some are hard to find and even harder to enjoy.

POPOS have variety types - parks, plazas, walkways, terraces, and snippets - where people can relax and take a break from city life. This kind of space is designed because of the 1985 Downtown Plan, which encourages developers to build and maintain public space in their properties in exchange for a density bonus, or as a condition of approval [3].

Although POPOS are designed for public, they are not widely known by people. Some indoor POPOS limit people visiting, which are hard for public to recognize the boundary between public and private property. Maintenance and management may also limit public visiting. Although the spaces should be recognized by the public, some developers hide the spaces from the public to keep the cost of maintenance low. In this study, I analyze the relationship between quality and popularity of POPOS.
